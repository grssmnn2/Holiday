//  ok so the coordinates are going to be props that are passed down from the result component 
//  and they would match the location / details that are provided in the card results 
//  I'll have to check the schema for that, too see where we are storing location data 
//  map result would be called in render array.map method when the results are being rendered to the screen 
//  and how we are storing that
//  for now, can provide coordinates of Hawaii  props.lat props.lgn => where would I be finding them>
//  initially thinking it's prolly from address 
//  Js library that converts address into lat/lgn or maybe there is something easier there
